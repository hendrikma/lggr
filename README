Changes in this Fork:

- Bumped up install.sh for easier setup
- Fixed some bugs
- Using only local lson-libs, because i get a bunch of errors in Browsers web-devtools. I assume some scripts are down/broken. So all online-jsonlibs ressources have been commented out. Scripts can be found under the contrib folder. The ressource of this scripts: https://lggr.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lggr_contrib.tar.gz
- Fixed some bugs, which only occur if using local libs
- Setting default pid to 9999 if no pid is provided
